# Gantt Chart Generator 📊

A web-based tool to generate Gantt charts and calculate TAT (Turnaround Time) and WT (Waiting Time) based on various scheduling algorithms. It currently supports the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm.

## Features

✨ **Intuitive Interface**: Easily input process details and select a scheduling algorithm.

📈 **Gantt Chart Generation**: Generate visual Gantt charts representing the scheduling order.

⏱️ **Turnaround Time (TAT) Calculation**: Calculate the turnaround time for each process.

⌚ **Waiting Time (WT) Calculation**: Calculate the waiting time for each process.

🔄 **Support for FCFS Algorithm**: The tool currently supports the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm.

🚀 **Extensibility**: Extend the tool to include other popular scheduling algorithms like Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), and more.
